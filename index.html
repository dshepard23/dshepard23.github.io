                            <div class="post-content">
                                <p>I get to work 40 hours a week from my couch. I get the autonomy I have always wanted and with my company, Rocket Insights, I am supported and allowed the freedom I have worked for. 
                                    Everyday, I wake up and get to do something I enjoy while being able to live comfortably and spend the day with my new puppy, Kairi. Life is great! And when I want to go to the office I have the option of a beautiful office in Newburyport or in Boston. It is wonderful.</p>

                            <p>I am a <em>registered nurse</em> and have been spent the last <strong>6 years</strong> or so in health care. 
                                It has completely changed me and my outlook on life and I've learned so much but I've decided that the added stress has taken a toll on my mental and physical health and it is time for a change!</p>
                            <p>I have recently started to explore new and old hobbies (check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cheeri_photography/?hl=en">insta</a> for some cool photos ) and started to learn how to write websites! <em>I'm excitd for this new chapter in my life and I am so excited to share this new journey with all of you</em></p>
